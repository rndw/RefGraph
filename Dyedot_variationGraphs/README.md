# DyeDot: Variation graphs from VCF

## To run:
Extract the archive containing several yeast vcf files in the VCFs dir. After extracting the archive you should several vcf files in the VCFs directory.

## Install python dependencies:

`pip3 install seaborn`

`pip3 install graphviz`

## Viewing dot files locally:
`apt-get install kgraphviewer kgraphviewer-dev`

kgraphviewer displays multiple edges incorrectly. The default is to merge edges, which, defeats the purpose of graphs.

As an alternative, try ZGRViewer. However, the SVG output doesn't colour the node backgrounds and thus limits the number of possible comparisons.

- Currently working on sequenceTubeMap viz.

## Run driver script:
Example command:

`$ python3 DRIVER_dyedot.py -p ./VCFs/ -o output -c chr7 -b 6000 -e 15000`

If you need help:

`python3 DRIVER_dyedot.py -h`

## Notes
Instructions on how to convert a multi-sample vcf file is included in the ./VCFs/readme. A URL with additional vcf files is supplied for download.

DyeDot was only tested on SNP data from yeast as an example. Testing on human data and large structural variants required.

## Interactive visualisation
Convert the graphviz (.dot or .gv) output to .gml format with `dot graph.gv | gv2gml > graph.gml` **OR** `gv2gml graph.dot -o graph.gml` and visualise with `Cytoscape 3.0+` via import.
